# Npnn
#### Neural network based on Python using Numpy.

* Several basic layers of neural network are implemented in [npnn/basic](https://github.com/ryanreadbooks/Npnn/tree/master/npnn/basic).
* Several basic optimizers are implemented in [npnn/optim](https://github.com/ryanreadbooks/Npnn/tree/master/npnn/optim).
* A container called Sequential(like in Pytorch) is implementd in [npnn/nn](https://github.com/ryanreadbooks/Npnn/tree/master/npnn/nn). It can be used to build a neural network.
